# R-PAGE
## Resistance's Portable-Adventure-Game-Engine

**R-PAGE** (pronounced 'arp√®ge') is a **C framework** meant to accelerate the creation of **adventure games** for the Amiga OCS/ECS range of computers. It is designed with portability in mind, speed performance being a lesser concern.<br>
R-PAGE is brought to you by the **demoscene** group [RESISTANCE](https://resistance.no/).

* Written in C language
* AmigaOS & OS-friendly for all the access to the Amiga hardware
* Portable code, builds on SAS/C
* Reportedly works on MorphOS using the built-in AmigaOS emulation layer
* AMIGA OCS/ECS only (AGA is on the roadmap)

### What can I do with this ?
At the moment, R-PAGE is more a framework than a full feature engine. Feel free to use it as a boostrap for your own adventure project. The roadmap, however, includes a very basic adventure game to showcase the features of this framework.

### Where is the API ?
You should start looking for [frwk.h](frwk_8h.html)

### Actual games based on R-PAGE:
* Athanor 2 by www.safargames.fr
* ShuffleP\*ck adventures (work in progress title)
* Next adventure game by www.safargames.fr
