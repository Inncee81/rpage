# R-PAGE
## Resistance's Portable-Adventure-Game-Engine

**R-PAGE** (pronounced 'arp√®ge') is a **C framework** meant to accelerate the creation of **adventure games** for the Amiga OCS/ECS range of computers. It is designed with portability in mind, speed performance being a lesser concern.<br>
R-PAGE is brought to you by the **demoscene** group known as [RESISTANCE](https://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=1572&order=release).

* Written in C language
* AmigaOS & OS-friendly for all the access to the Amiga hardware
* Portable code, builds on SAS/C
* Reportedly works on MorphOS using the built-in AmigaOS emulation layer
* AMIGA OCS/ECS only (AGA is on the roadmap)
