\subsection*{Resistance\textquotesingle{}s Portable-\/\+Adventure-\/\+Game-\/\+Engine}

{\bfseries{R-\/\+P\+A\+GE}} (pronounced \textquotesingle{}arp√®ge\textquotesingle{}) is a {\bfseries{C framework}} meant to accelerate the creation of {\bfseries{adventure games}} for the Amiga O\+C\+S/\+E\+CS range of computers. It is designed with portability in mind, speed performance being a lesser concern.~\newline
 R-\/\+P\+A\+GE is brought to you by the {\bfseries{demoscene}} group \href{https://resistance.no/}{\texttt{ R\+E\+S\+I\+S\+T\+A\+N\+CE}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Written in C language
\item Amiga\+OS \& O\+S-\/friendly for all the access to the Amiga hardware
\item Portable code, builds on S\+A\+S/C
\item Reportedly works on Morph\+OS using the built-\/in Amiga\+OS emulation layer
\item A\+M\+I\+GA O\+C\+S/\+E\+CS only (A\+GA is on the roadmap)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{What can I do with this ?}

At the moment, R-\/\+P\+A\+GE is more a framework than a full feature engine. Feel free to use it as a boostrap for your own adventure project. The roadmap, however, includes a very basic adventure game to showcase the features of this framework.
